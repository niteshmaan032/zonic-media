/*
 * LOCAL SEO FOR COMMERCIAL CLEANING — revamped July 2026 onto the approved
 * local SEO template layout (see /services/template-seo). Design/classes come
 * from templateSeo.css (scoped under .tseo-page); all copy, mockups, FAQs, and
 * schema are commercial-cleaning / janitorial specific and written for B2B
 * decision-makers (facility, office & property managers). Form leads submit as
 * service "Local SEO" (on the API whitelist).
 *
 * This page was previously a thin wrapper (page.tsx) that rendered a separate
 * ./CommercialSeoPage component. It is now fully self-contained to match the
 * template. The full prior JSX lives in git history.
 *
 * ==========================================================================
 * OLD IMPLEMENTATION — kept commented for reference during the revamp.

    question: "What's Included in Your Commercial Cleaning Local SEO Services?",
    answer:
      "Every commercial cleaning campaign covers the full local ranking system: Google Business Profile optimization, citation building and cleanup, review growth, on-page SEO for your janitorial, office cleaning, and service-area pages, local content, and a monthly report that shows rankings, RFQ inquiries, and signed contracts — not vanity metrics.",
  },
  {
    question: "How Long Does Janitorial SEO Take to Show Results?",
    answer:
      "Most commercial cleaning companies see measurable movement within 60 to 90 days — better map pack visibility, more profile actions, and more inquiries for searches like 'commercial cleaning near me' and 'office cleaning services.' Competitive metros take longer to fully dominate, but the trajectory is visible from the first monthly report, and momentum compounds as more facility and property managers find you.",
  },
  {
    question: "How Much Does Local SEO for Commercial Cleaning Cost?",
    answer:
      "Pricing depends on how many locations you cover, how competitive your market is, and how aggressively you want to grow your contract pipeline. After a free audit we quote a flat monthly price — no long-term contracts and no surprise line items.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do You Guarantee First-Page Google Rankings for Cleaning Keywords?",
    answer:
      "Our track record speaks for itself — most commercial cleaning clients reach top-three map pack positions for their core keywords, and every campaign is built on the exact signals Google rewards. Because Google's results change daily, no agency can honestly promise a fixed position, so we guarantee what matters: full transparency. You see exactly where you rank, what improved, and what we did each month — and with no long-term contracts, we earn your business with results.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do Commercial Cleaning Companies Really Need Google Business Profile Optimization?",
    answer:
      "Yes — it is the single biggest lever in commercial cleaning local SEO. Your Google Business Profile decides whether you appear in the local map pack when a facility or office manager searches for janitorial help, and it drives your inquiry volume, website visits, and review visibility. We optimize every field, category, photo, and post so Google trusts your profile and decision-makers shortlist you.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can You Help Multi-Site and B2B Commercial Cleaning Companies?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. We build local SEO systems for single-territory operators and multi-site janitorial brands alike — service-area targeting, individual location pages, and map visibility for every city and business district you cover, all reported in one clear dashboard aimed at the property and facility managers who sign the contracts.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why Choose Zonic Media over Another Janitorial SEO Company?",
    answer:
      "We specialize in local B2B service businesses like commercial cleaning, and everything is done in-house by the team you actually talk to. You get a dedicated strategist, monthly reporting tied to RFQs and signed contracts, and work that is built to compound month after month — not churn.",

                    When an office, medical, or industrial facility needs a new
                    cleaning provider, the first thing the decision-maker does is
                    search &ldquo;commercial cleaning near me&rdquo; and request
                    a walkthrough from one of the top three companies on the map.
                    That is an enormous, high-intent growth channel sitting right
                    in front of your business — and it is exactly the channel we
                    have spent years mastering for commercial cleaning companies.
