/*
 * LOCAL SEO FOR LAW FIRMS — revamped July 2026 onto the approved local SEO
 * template layout (see /services/template-seo). Design/classes come from
 * templateSeo.css (scoped under .tseo-page); all copy, mockups, FAQs, and
 * schema are law-firm/attorney specific. YMYL/legal niche — claims stay
 * careful: we never promise case outcomes, only search visibility and
 * inquiries. Form leads submit as service "Local SEO" (on the API whitelist).
 *
 * ==========================================================================
 * OLD IMPLEMENTATION — kept commented for reference during the revamp.
 * The previous page rendered a separate client component (./LawSeoPage) with
 * the car-tow/philaDigital/lawSeo layout.
 * ==========================================================================

    question: "What's Included in Your Local SEO for Law Firms?",
    answer:
      "Every law firm campaign covers the full local ranking system: Google Business Profile optimization, citation building and cleanup, review growth, on-page SEO for your practice-area and location pages, local content, and a monthly report that shows rankings, calls, and qualified case inquiries — not vanity metrics.",
  },
  {
    question: "How Long Does Law Firm SEO Take to Show Results?",
    answer:
      "Most law firms see measurable movement within 60 to 90 days — better map pack visibility, more profile actions, and more calls for searches like 'personal injury lawyer near me' and 'criminal defense attorney.' Competitive legal markets take longer to fully dominate, but the trajectory is visible from the first monthly report, and the momentum compounds month over month.",
  },
  {
    question: "How Much Does Local SEO for Law Firms Cost?",
    answer:
      "Pricing depends on how many attorneys and locations you run, how competitive your practice areas are, and how aggressively you want to grow. After a free audit we quote a flat monthly price — no long-term contracts and no surprise line items.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do You Guarantee First-Page Google Rankings for Legal Keywords?",
    answer:
      "We guarantee transparency and search visibility — never legal outcomes. No ethical agency can promise you'll win cases, and because Google's results change daily, no one can honestly promise a fixed ranking position either. What we do promise: work built on the exact local signals Google rewards, and a monthly report that shows exactly where you rank, what improved, and what we did. Most clients reach top-three map pack positions for their core keywords, and with no long-term contracts we earn your business with results.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do Law Firms Really Need Google Business Profile Optimization?",
    answer:
      "Yes — it is the single biggest lever in local SEO for law firms. Your Google Business Profile decides whether you show up in the local map pack when someone searches for a lawyer near them, and it drives your call volume, direction requests, and review visibility. We optimize every field, practice-area category, photo, and post so Google trusts your profile and prospective clients choose it.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can You Help Multi-Attorney or Multi-Location Law Firms?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. We build local SEO systems for solo practitioners and multi-location firms alike — service-area targeting, individual location and attorney pages, and map visibility for every city and practice area you cover, all reported in one clear dashboard.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why Choose Zonic Media over Another Attorney SEO Company?",
    answer:
      "We specialize in local service businesses and understand how cautious legal clients search and choose, and everything is done in-house by the team you actually talk to. You get a dedicated strategist, monthly reporting tied to calls and qualified case inquiries, and work built to compound month after month — not churn.",

                    When someone is in an accident, facing charges, or filing for
                    divorce, the first thing they do is search &ldquo;lawyer near

                    front of your firm — and it is exactly the channel we have
